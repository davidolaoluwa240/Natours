HTML LOAD => HTML PARSE => DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL(DOM) IS CREATED
===========> CSS LOAD => CSS PARSE => CSS OBJECT MODEL(CSSOM) IS CREATED
CSS PARSING PHASE

- Browser resolve conflicting css rules due to cascade
- Browser process the last value to be rendered

Cascade
It is process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts between different css rules and declarations, when more than one rules applies to a certain element

Inheritance
Is a way of propagating property from parent element up to the child element

ACHITECT MINDSET
-THINK -> Think about the layout of your webpage or your web app before writing the code
-BUILD -> Build your layout in html and css with a consistent structure for naming classes
-ARCHITECT -> Create a logical architecture for css with files and folders

BEM(BLOCK ELEMENT MODIFIER)
BLOCK: Standalone component that is meaningful on its own
ELEMENT: Part of a block that has no standalone meaning
MODIFIER: A different version of the block or an element i.e different modification of a block or element. It is a way to modify the behavior or appearance of a block or element

The 7/1 Pattern
7 different folders for partial sass files, and 1 main sass file to import all other files into a compiled css stylesheet

-base/ => Basic project definitions. It is use for reseting styles, animations, typography, utilities. Base is where we put our basic project definitions
-components/ => Reusable building block that make up our website or app. Components are held together by the layout of the page
-layout/ => For each of piece of the global layout of the entire project eg a gloabal footer, header and more. The layout should work everywhere in our web page
-pages/ => When we have a specific style for a page eg home then they should be put inside the pages folder
-themes/ We use this folder when have a app that have different themes
-abstracts/ => Where we put code that won't output any css eg variables, mixins, functions
-vendors => where we can put third party styles eg bootstrap, animation libaries

Three Basic Principles for responsive web design

1. Fluid Grids and Layout: To allow content to easily adapt to the current viewport width used to browse the website. Uses % rather than px for all layout-related length

2. Flexible and Responsive Images: Images behave differently than text content, and so we need to ensure that they also adapt nicely to the current viewport

3. Media Queries: Allow us to changes styles based on different viewport
